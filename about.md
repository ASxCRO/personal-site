        <p>
          I'm a Fullstack Engineer based in Zagreb, Croatia, with over 5 years of experience in software development. My journey in tech started during my studies at Virovitica University of Applied Sciences, where I discovered my passion for building software that solves real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I've worked on large-scale government and fintech projects at FINA, collaborated with international teams at Atos, and currently contribute to innovative solutions at Axians Hrvatska. I specialize in .NET, Vue.js, and cloud technologies, with a strong focus on microservices architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I enjoy sharing knowledge with others. I've had the privilege of teaching object-oriented programming to students at the Polytechnic of Pozega, which reinforced my belief in the importance of clear communication and mentorship in our field.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or writing about software development best practices.
